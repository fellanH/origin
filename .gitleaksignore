# Add fingerprints of known-safe findings below. Each line is a gitleaks
# "fingerprint" hash. To obtain a fingerprint, run:
#
#   gitleaks detect --report-format json --report-path report.json
#
# Then copy the "Fingerprint" field from the finding you want to suppress.
#
# IMPORTANT: Every entry MUST have a comment explaining why the finding is
# safe and who approved the override. Entries without justification will be
# removed during security reviews.
